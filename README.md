This program is designed to solve the 8 Queens problem on an 8x8 chessboard.

Description
The 8 Queens problem involves placing 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This program uses a recursive algorithm to find all possible solutions to this problem.

Installation and Setup
To run this program, follow these steps:

Clone the GitHub repository using the git clone command.
Navigate to the project directory and activate the virtual environment.
Install the dependencies by running the necessary commands, such as pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the program using the command python main.py.
Project Structure
Provide a brief overview of the important files and directories in the project.

Queen_Puzzle.py: The main file of the program, which includes the algorithm for solving the 8 Queens problem.
requirements.txt: A file containing the project dependencies.
Usage
In an 8x8 chessboard, indicate each queen's position as (row, column). The program will find all possible solutions for placing 8 queens on the chessboard and print them.
